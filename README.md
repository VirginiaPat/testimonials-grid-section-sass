## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

I first build this layout with just css but decided to re-build it with sass. It is my first attempt in using sass and I found it easier and cleaner. I also think that the solution is better that my first try.
